# React PDF Font Loading Issue 
Project demonstrating issues with font loading in React PDF

Run `make dev` to run the project in the browser
Run `make generate-pdf` to generate a pdf

Running either of these commands will fail because the project attempts to laod the roboto font. Removing all usages of the late font will resolve the issue
